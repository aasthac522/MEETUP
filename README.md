## Agile Methodology

Webinars were held as part of the programe to teach us Agile Methodology. Agile Scrum Methodology is a project management methodology that is best used to improve a project iteration by iteration. Each iteration is divided into sprints, with the goal of building the most important feature first and then improving the project as a potentially deliverable product.

1. Explored all the libraries and packages, Finally used WebRTC.
2. Build Video calling feature allowing two people to connect.
3. Then added microphone and camera buttons.
